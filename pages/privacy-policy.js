      <p>
        The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile
        device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie.
        Session cookies last until you stop browsing and persistent cookies last
        until they expire or are deleted. Most of the cookies we use are
        persistent and will expire between 30 minutes and two years from the
        date they are downloaded to your device.

        You can control and manage cookies in various ways. Please keep in mind
        that removing or blocking cookies can negatively impact your user
        experience and parts of our website may no longer be fully accessible.
